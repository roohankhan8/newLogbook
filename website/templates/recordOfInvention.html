      Log The Invention Journey

    <h5>Invention or Innovation. What’s the difference?</h5>
    <p>
      The invention involves engineering and developing a new solution, product,
      or process. When you improve upon an existing solution, product, or
      process to solve a problem (for example make it more convenient to
      increase its uses) it becomes an innovation. An invention is an entirely
      new solution to a problem, a radically different breakthrough that
      achieves a unique function. Innovation is an improvement over the existing
      solution
    </p>
    <h5>Why do inventors record their invention process?</h5>
    <p>
      All inventions have a purpose and use. An invention is complete when a
      successful prototype is ready and the inventor is confident that s/he can
      make exact copies of it. However, a prototype results from many
      steps.Inventors record every detail of these steps for many reasons, for
      example, to be able to replicate the prototype with accuracy; to prove
      that they went through those steps and so they are the legal inventor of
      the prototype and to record all learnings that happen in the process. This
      log is the recorder of your invention. Record each step you did, why you
      did what you did, how you did it, in whose presence you did it. Tomorrow
      if this invention becomes BIG, you will be able to use this log to prove
      you are the inventor. Invention log is also part of the patenting process.
    </p>
    <h5>How to Use this Record of Invention (ROI)?</h5>
    <p>
      The sections of this ROI follow the process of invention. As you move
      further in the process, keep recording everything, what, why, how, and
      also who and where, when applicable. One way to figure you are doing
      everything right is by making sure that you are following the sections in
      the given sequence and completing a section before moving to the next one.
      Each team/ project needs to complete one invention log.
