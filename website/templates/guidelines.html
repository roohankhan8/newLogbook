        Once the prototype of the product is ready, there are four decisions you
        need to make to see how you can effectively market this product. These
        are price, branding, value and how you will sell the product.
        <br />
        Decide on a catchy name for the product that will appeal to most people
        and also convey the purpose of the product. Think about words and word
        combinations that describe your product and the solution it provides.
        Then use them to decide on a name.<br />
